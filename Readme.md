# BuildiFactory
### An inventory stocking simulator

This was my submission to the 2020 Game Maker's Toolkit Game Jam. You can find the submission here: https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2020/rate/697514

### Controls

WASD controls the left buttons
Arrow Keys control the right set of buttons

### Assets

I used:
  - 'Cute RPG UI Kit' by "ArtByKandles"
  - 'Human Fantasy Animated Flash Pack 1' by frostzerox

Both asset packs were bought as a part of the Huble RPG Game Dev Bundle

## Design Notes, uneditied:

	As the game ramps up by adding too much criteria, it feels out of control
		i.e. press the red button at precicesly 1:30s
		as soon as possible, press the green button 10 times
		dial the right dial to 210 degrees
		press a sequence of buttons
	basically a UI puzzler
		complex UI control panel
		vague instructions
		silly buttons
			Set of colored buttons
			Set of dials, each with a number of possible positions (i.e. 1-4, 1-8)
			Set of toggles

		randomize layout probably
	Option to assign or bind certain buttons or actions to keys, allowing for mastery of the arbitrary criterea
	Theme
		factory worker for some obtuse construction?
		Magic factory
		space ship pilot
	Consequences
		Completing tasks needs some visual represenatation
			Objects completed should go up, not lives go down
		Failing tasks needs repercussions
			lives system? (nah, see above)
			mess with the UI somehow - I like this one
